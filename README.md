# How to run

This is a typical `PHP + MySQL` application, so you need an http-server with PHP interpreter and MySQL (MariaDB).

There are **THREE** ways to launch this zoo relatively easily.

### Docker

Docker is something resembling virtual-machine (but not exactly) widely used in industry. We describe
the content of "containers" we need in a file (or few) and docker prepares everything. You'll need to install
docker itself (there could be subtle steps like setting user group in linux but generally it is not much
complicated) - this is available in linux, windows and OsX. Then run files `docker-build.sh` to build an
image containing our `Apache2 httpd + PHP` server with MariaDB in one. then `docker-run.sh` to launch container
from it. If all is fine, the site should be ready at [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080)

### Free Hosting

Pick some free hosting, for example [AwardSpace / AtWebpages](https://www.awardspace.com/) and simply copy
files there. You'll need setup database here also and put its details into configuration, but at the first
step this is not important.

Then you'll get the site running on the web. There could be some limitations about some auxiliary functions
(e.g. 3rd party login etc) but that's not much important for you now (such things anyway require efforts to setup).

### LAMPP / XAMPP

With this approach you'll find software package (by the name XAMPP probably) which contains HTTP server, PHP and MySQL
inside and set up on your machine. It is not very difficult also and in some respects more handy than with docker.
Then copy files there and setup database.
